# CAPSTONE
Contained in this repo is our(all collaborators of the repo) senior year capstone project. We will implement an IOS app that will use a convolution neural network(CNN) to detect typed characters in an image containing a dated event and plot the event on the users calendar. 

characterCreator.py creates the training samples we will use for training of our NN. 
UTF-8_Char-Num_Representation.txt is the numberical translation for the characters used in characterCreator.py.
